This project aims at visualising different pathways involved in types I diabetes.

It uses Wikipathways queries to fetch the different component of each pathway to link them together. Additionaly it records the frequency of the different pathways elements across the pathways. This is done to understand how interconected different pathways are within this desease. 

The index.html is responsible for the webpage layout. 

The style.css is mainly the formating and styling of the webpage.

The logic.js is a javascript file fetching the information, processing and correctly and logically positioning it for the html file to present.
